## 27-09-2019 meeting

### 1. Imputation below LOD

See results and conclusions in doc: [imputation_below_lod_2019-09-25](docs/imputation_below_lod_2019-09-25.html)

### 2. Correction for protocol variables

Results without conclusions:

* phenols: [protocol_variables_vs_phenols_2019-09-25](docs/protocol_variables_vs_phenols_2019-09-25.html)
* phthalates: [protocol_variables_vs_phthalates_2019-09-25](docs/protocol_variables_vs_phthalates_2019-09-25.html)

Need to discuss the following questions:

* Which are the reasons to correct? (I see gain of power and better proxy for descriptive, any other?)
* Correction does not "look" good for most compounds (cf. corrected plots). Possible reasons:
  * Skewed distributions (even on box cox transformed)
  * cendored values substituted by LOD/sqrt(2) (even though analysis restricted to high detection compounds)
* What are the benefices/risks of that method of correction?
* Should we correct?

### 3. Variable coding

See doc: [variable_coding_2019-09-24](docs/variable_coding_2019-09-24.html)
